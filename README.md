Project: Tesla Stock Closing Price Forecasting
Objective:

Predict future closing prices of Tesla (TSLA) stock using historical stock price data with time series forecasting techniques.

Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Import Libraries

We'll use Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and yfinance for data.

2. Load Tesla Stock Data

Use yfinance to get historical TSLA stock data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

3. Data Preprocessing

Keep only the Close price.

Handle missing values (if any).

Convert dates into datetime format.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Plot the stock price trend.

Check for seasonality or patterns.

5. Feature Engineering

Create lag features (previous day prices).

Add rolling mean and rolling standard deviation for trend and volatility.

6. Train-Test Split

Split data chronologically into train and test sets (e.g., 80%-20%).

7. Model Selection

You can start with:

Linear Regression (simple baseline model)

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost (if you want more accuracy)

LSTM (for deep learning approach)

8. Model Evaluation

Use metrics such as:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² (R-squared score)

9. Visualization

Plot Actual vs Predicted closing prices for better insights.
